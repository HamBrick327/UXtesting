It's really scary when you lose your account, but don't worry! We're here to help you and get your account back. Just follow these steps and remember to keep yourself safe in the future.

Getting your account back
 
First, you need to get rid of any bad stuff on your computer. If you accidentally downloaded something from a bad website, it could have made your account not safe. Run a virus scan on your computer to remove any harmful files or programs. Restart your computer and run the scan again, just to be sure.

Also, delete any extensions you added to your internet browser. Only use extensions from websites that are safe and trusted.

Next, you'll need to change your account password. Make sure you pick a password that is strong and not easy for others to guess. You can follow the steps provided to reset your password.

To make your account even more secure, you can turn on something called "2-Step Verification". This will add extra security to your account. You can find this feature in the Settings > Security section of your account. It's explained in more detail on our website.

If resetting your password doesn't work

If resetting your password doesn't work and you still can't get into your account, you can contact our Customer Support for help. We want to make sure we're talking to the real owner of the account, so make sure to contact us from the first email address you used for the account. If you don't have that email anymore, we can still help you, but it might take some extra steps.

If you lost things on your account

We want to help, but we can't always get back everything you've lost. However, in some cases, we might be able to help you recover some of your things. You need to contact us within 30 days of your account being compromised to see if we can help you. Please keep in mind that we can't guarantee that we will be able to restore your account or get back all your virtual items or currency.

Keeping your account safe

To keep your account safe, you should enable something called "2-Step Verification" using an app called Authenticator. This will make it much harder for people to get into your account, even if they know your password or email. You can find more information on our website about how to do this.

Trades, deals, and scams
 
It's really important to only trade and make deals within our official systems. If you make a trade or purchase outside of our system, the other person could trick you and take your stuff without giving you anything. We don't support or help with these types of trades. If you come across someone trying to make deals outside of our system, you should report them using the Report Abuse feature. Stealing accounts or items is not allowed and we will delete any accounts involved in theft.

Remember to stay safe and be careful! If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. You are the best person to protect your account from being hacked.
